# Specification Quality Checklist: Main Page (홈 화면)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on WHAT the page should do (display navigation, show products, filter by region) without mentioning React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, or specific component architecture.

✅ **User value focused**: All requirements written from user perspective (e.g., "A visitor arrives at 우동금 and wants to discover local jewelry products").

✅ **Non-technical language**: Uses business terms (region, category, carousel) rather than technical jargon (components, state, hooks).

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, and Assumptions all present and filled.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS

✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete with specific values (e.g., "5 seconds" for carousel auto-advance, "1024px" for mobile breakpoint documented in Assumptions).

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-002 lists specific regions to test for, FR-005 specifies "at least 3 slides").

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC entries include specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "under 3 seconds", SC-006: "90%+ accessibility score").

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Criteria focus on user outcomes (load time, interaction time, accessibility score) not technical implementation.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has 5-7 Given-When-Then scenarios covering happy paths and variations.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 5 distinct edge cases documented with expected behaviors (no products, image load failures, JS disabled, slow network, window resize).

✅ **Scope bounded**: Clearly defined as "main page" with specific components (navigation, search, hero, products, footer). User stories are prioritized P1-P3.

✅ **Assumptions documented**: 10 assumptions listed covering data sources, authentication, search behavior, content, and technical constraints.

### Feature Readiness - PASS

✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: Each of 3 user stories includes detailed acceptance scenarios (5-7 scenarios per story).

✅ **User scenarios cover flows**: P1 covers core search/filter flow, P2 covers passive discovery flow, P3 covers navigation flow.

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria provide clear, measurable targets for feature completion.

✅ **No implementation leaks**: Spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout (mentions "dropdown" not "select element", "product cards" not "React components").

## Status: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items passed. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

## Notes

- The spec makes informed assumptions about typical web application behaviors (e.g., 1024px breakpoint, modern browser support) which are documented in the Assumptions section
- No clarifications needed - the feature scope is well-defined based on the provided main-page-components documentation
- Success criteria are appropriately ambitious but achievable for a modern web application
