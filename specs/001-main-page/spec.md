# Feature Specification: Main Page (홈 화면)

**Feature Branch**: `001-main-page`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create main page with @docs/main-page-components.md ."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Products by Location and Category (Priority: P1)

A visitor arrives at 우동금 (Udonggeum) and wants to discover local jewelry products. They need to quickly filter products by their neighborhood and preferred jewelry category (rings, necklaces, bracelets, etc.) to find relevant items near them.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - connecting users with local jewelry stores. Without effective browsing and filtering, users cannot find relevant products, making the entire platform unusable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the main page, selecting a region from the dropdown, selecting a product category, clicking search, and verifying that appropriate products are displayed. Delivers immediate value by showing users relevant local jewelry.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the main page, **When** they click the region dropdown, **Then** they see a list of available regions (서울 강동구, 서울 강남구, 부산 해운대구, etc.)
2. **Given** a user has selected a region, **When** they click the product category dropdown, **Then** they see jewelry categories (반지, 목걸이, 팔찌, 귀걸이, 발찌)
3. **Given** a user has selected both region and category, **When** they click the search button, **Then** relevant products matching those filters are displayed
4. **Given** a user has not selected any filters, **When** they click search, **Then** all available products are displayed
5. **Given** a mobile user, **When** they access the page, **Then** the search section displays in a mobile-friendly vertical layout

### User Story 2 - View Featured Products and Navigate (Priority: P2)

A user wants to explore popular products and promotional content without having to search. They should see an engaging hero carousel with promotional imagery and be able to browse popular products organized by category.

**Why this priority**: Hero sections and featured products drive engagement and conversions. This provides a passive browsing experience for users who aren't sure what they're looking for, reducing bounce rates and increasing discovery.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the main page and verifying the hero carousel auto-plays promotional content, and that popular products are organized into browsable category tabs. Delivers value by showcasing trending products and promotions without requiring user input.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user loads the main page, **When** the page renders, **Then** a hero carousel displays with 3 promotional images
2. **Given** the hero carousel is visible, **When** 5 seconds pass, **Then** the carousel automatically advances to the next slide
3. **Given** the hero carousel is visible, **When** the user clicks the previous/next navigation buttons, **Then** the carousel moves to the corresponding slide
4. **Given** a user scrolls to the popular products section, **When** they view the section, **Then** they see category tabs (반지, 목걸이, 팔찌)
5. **Given** category tabs are visible, **When** the user clicks a category tab, **Then** 3-4 popular products from that category are displayed in a grid
6. **Given** a user views a product card, **When** they see the card, **Then** it displays product image, name, and price
7. **Given** a mobile user, **When** they view the popular products grid, **Then** it displays 1 column on mobile and expands to 2-4 columns on larger screens

### User Story 3 - Navigate Site and Access Key Features (Priority: P3)

A user needs to access other parts of the website (product listings, store directory, shopping cart, account) and understand what the company offers. The navigation should be consistent, accessible, and provide quick access to all major sections.

**Why this priority**: Navigation is essential infrastructure that enables users to move beyond the homepage. While important, users can still accomplish P1 and P2 tasks without full navigation. This provides the framework for a complete user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking each navigation menu item and verifying it leads to the expected section/page. Footer links should also navigate correctly. Delivers value by providing site-wide access to all features and company information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a desktop user, **When** they view the navigation bar, **Then** they see horizontal menu items: 상품, 매장, 장바구니, 로그인/마이페이지
2. **Given** a mobile user, **When** they view the navigation bar, **Then** they see a hamburger menu icon that opens a dropdown with the same menu items
3. **Given** a user clicks the logo, **When** the logo is clicked, **Then** they are navigated back to the homepage
4. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they click a navigation menu item, **Then** they navigate to the corresponding section/page
5. **Given** a user scrolls to the footer, **When** they view the footer, **Then** they see three columns: 회사정보 (company info), 고객지원 (customer support), 법적고지 (legal notices)
6. **Given** a user views the footer, **When** they see it, **Then** copyright information "Copyright © 2024 우리동네금은방. All rights reserved." is displayed
7. **Given** a user clicks a footer link, **When** the link is clicked, **Then** they navigate to the corresponding page or section

## Assumptions

1. **Product Data Source**: Assuming products will be fetched from a backend API. If products are hardcoded for MVP, this should be clarified.

2. **Authentication State**: Assuming the navigation displays "로그인" for unauthenticated users and "마이페이지" for authenticated users, but doesn't require authentication to view the main page.

3. **Search Behavior**: Assuming "search" filters products but doesn't navigate away from the main page - results are displayed in-place or in an adjacent section.

4. **Hero Carousel Content**: Assuming carousel images and content will be provided by the business team. Placeholder images acceptable for MVP.

5. **Popular Products Logic**: Assuming "popular products" are determined by backend logic (sales, views, etc.) and not manually curated on the frontend.

6. **Footer Links**: Assuming footer links navigate to other pages that will be built separately. Links can be placeholders (href="#") for MVP if those pages don't exist yet.

7. **Mobile Breakpoint**: Using 1024px as the breakpoint between mobile and desktop layouts (standard for responsive design).

8. **Browser Support**: Assuming support for modern browsers (last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). No IE11 support required.

9. **Internationalization**: Assuming the application is Korean-language only. No multi-language support needed.

10. **Cart/Wishlist Actions**: Assuming "장바구니" and "찜하기" buttons on product cards are functional (update state/storage) but don't need to navigate away from the page.
